# Simple Currency Conversion PHP Application


The app should fetch and display currency conversion rates. To get rates you need to use the free API: http://fixer.io. For this assessment, you'll have a week to complete.

The app consists of two pages: the first one is currency conversion rates, the other one is a management page.

## Page 1: Display
Display all conversion rates in this format:

|Currency 1 |  Currency 2 | Rate  |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
|USD        |  EUR        | 0.922 |
|PLN        |  CZK        | 6.204 |

Below, display a link or button that will redirect to page 2.


## Page 2: Manage
Allow adding conversion pairs in this format: [USD] [EUR] [+]

[USD], [EUR] are selects letting you pick conversion pair, and [+] is a button saving it.

Below, list all added conversion pairs and allow the user to remove them with a click of a link or a button.

## Requirements
* Conversion pairs and rates should also be saved in the database. 
* You can use any PHP framework or none at all.
* You can use any DB engine you want (SQLite, MySQL, Postgres).
* Don't worry too much about front-end but if you want to make a good impression you can spend some time on the frontend.
* Make sure README includes all required steps to run your app on a Unix-like environment. We'll do our best to run your app on our computers, but if you use something non-standard you should let us know about it.

*Once you're done please upload your finished work to GitHub or bitbucket so we can easily download and review it.*
